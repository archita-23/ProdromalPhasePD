                <h2>Clinical Context</h2>
                <p>Neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s develop gradually over many years before clinical diagnosis becomes possible. During this prodromal phase, individuals experience subtle behavioral changes including reduced sleep quality, decreased daily activity, mood variability, and increased fatigue. These changes occur across multiple physiological systems and are usually mild when observed individually, making them difficult to identify in routine healthcare.
Continuous monitoring and pattern-based analysis of these signals can help detect early deviations from normal behavior, enabling risk awareness before visible symptoms appear.</p>

                    <br><h4> MARKET RESEARCH</h4>
                    <p>Most current digital health platforms focus on fitness tracking or general wellness metrics such as step count, calories, and heart rate. While they collect valuable data, they do not analyze long-term behavioral trends or detect multi-parameter deviations associated with neurological decline.
                        There is a gap between data collection and meaningful interpretation. A system capable of learning a person’s normal behavior and identifying abnormal patterns over time can transform raw health data into preventive health insights.</p>

                    <br><h4>EXISTING TOOLS</h4>
                    <p>Clinical diagnosis typically depends on neurological examination after noticeable symptoms occur, which is relatively late in disease progression. Existing medical tools are designed for confirmation rather than early monitoring and are not intended for continuous observation.
                        Therefore, there is a need for a computational approach that uses everyday behavioral data to identify abnormal patterns. Such a system would provide non-invasive, continuous, and low-cost early risk awareness to support preventive healthcare monitoring.</p>
